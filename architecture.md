# Chess Endgame Kata Trainer - Architecture

## Overview
A web-based chess training application focused on drilling fundamental endgame positions. Users practice specific endgame techniques against perfect computer play until the patterns become automatic.

## Core Concept
- **Kata Philosophy**: Repetitive, focused practice of essential endgame positions
- **Perfect Opposition**: Computer plays theoretically perfect defensive/winning moves
- **Technique Validation**: User must execute the correct technique to succeed

## Initial Endgame Positions
1. **Lucena Position** - Rook + Pawn vs Rook (winning technique)
2. **Philidor Position** - Rook + Pawn vs Rook (drawing technique) 
3. **King + Pawn vs King** - Opposition and breakthrough techniques

## Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI)
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (vanilla or lightweight framework)
- **Chess Engine**: Stockfish (via python-chess library)
- **Board Display**: chess.js + chessboard.js for interactive board

### Core Components

#### 1. Position Manager
```
- FEN string storage for each endgame type
- Position setup and validation
- Move history tracking
```

#### 2. Engine Interface
```
- Stockfish integration (high depth for perfect play)
- Move evaluation and selection
- Position analysis (win/draw/loss evaluation)
```

#### 3. Game Controller
```
- Turn management (user vs computer)
- Move validation and execution
- Win/draw/loss detection
- Session tracking
```

#### 4. Web Interface
```
- Interactive chessboard
- Position selection menu
- Move feedback system
- Progress tracking
```

## Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

### Features
1. **Position Selection**: Choose from 3 core endgame types
2. **Interactive Board**: Click-to-move interface
3. **Perfect Computer Play**: Stockfish at depth 20+ for accurate responses
4. **Outcome Detection**: Automatic win/draw/loss recognition
5. **Reset Functionality**: Restart position for repeated practice

### User Flow
1. Select endgame type (Lucena/Philidor/K+P vs K)
2. Board displays starting position with user to move
3. User makes move via clicking
4. Computer responds with perfect move
5. Continue until position is won/drawn/lost
6. Display outcome with option to retry

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Engine
- Set up Python backend with Flask
- Integrate Stockfish via python-chess
- Implement FEN position loading
- Create basic API endpoints for moves

### Phase 2: Web Interface
- HTML page with chessboard.js
- JavaScript for move handling and API calls
- Position selection dropdown
- Basic styling

### Phase 3: Game Logic
- Move validation and execution
- Computer move generation
- Game state evaluation
- Session management

## Dependencies
- `python-chess`: Chess logic and Stockfish interface
- `flask`: Web framework
- `stockfish`: Chess engine binary
- `chessboard.js`: Interactive chess board
- `chess.js`: Chess move validation (frontend)

## Success Criteria
- User can select and play all 3 endgame types
- Computer plays perfect defensive/winning moves
- Positions reset for repeated practice
- Clean, responsive web interface
- Clear win/draw feedback

## Future Enhancements
- More endgame positions (Q vs R, minor piece endings)
- Difficulty levels (engine depth adjustment)
- Progress tracking and statistics
- Hint system for struggling positions
- Timed practice modes
